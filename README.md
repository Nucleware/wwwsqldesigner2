# WWW SQL Designer 2

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

This is a port to React of the nice [WWW SQL Designer](https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner) project.

This project aims to be compatible with the original, and look and feel like it as closely as possible.

## Motivation

The original project is useful, but it's a bit outdated. I found it while looking for projects that
have graphical diagram editors. I'm not a front-end developer, but I wanted to learn how this specific
functionality is implemented in various projects. I'm hoping to get some reusable components out of this.
